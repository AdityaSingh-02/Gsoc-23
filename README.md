During the 3 months in GSOC'23 @Rocket.Chat I made multiple tours which would benefit new contributors.

I intend to maintain this repository as a work progress/final report summary of my GSoC work and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract
Creating step-by-step guided tours with the help of CodeTour extension.

Yearly more than 500 contributors show interest in contributing to Rocket.Chat but more than 90% of them end up leaving their journey, This project would help new contributors and they would easily learn about the codebase without reading the complete documentation. 

## Deliverables
The following are the Deliverables
- Step by Step guided tours
- Set of 9 Essential tours
- Best for the beginners

**All of the targets were completed during the GSOC period‚ú®**

## ‚öí Demo

- A simple tour representing how a message is sent from the client side
